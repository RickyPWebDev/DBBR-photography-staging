          <h2>ABOUT US </h2>
          <p>Based in Nottinghamshire we’re two friends that met at university and bonded over our love of fitness,
             bad jokes and last but not least… 
             <br/><br/>
             photography. We have a love for making people smile and capturing moments 
             and what better way to do that than through a lens. 
             
             <br/><br/>
             We always bring the positive vibes whether that be at weddings, 
             modelling shoots or corporate events to ensure we capture the best moments.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            We’ve always had a passion for being creative. So when we got our first cameras the first thing we did is push the limits of our knowledge and see what we could create. 

            <br/><br/>
            This has evolved over time and we’ve been so proud to capture beautiful imagery for a variety of different events.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            We have worked on many personal and corporate photography projects across the years and this has given us amazing experience to capture important,
             creative and meaningful moments so for many people with who we’ve been so lucky to work with.
          </p>

          <h2>Are we right for you?</h2>

          <p>
            Every event is unique. There can be chilled environments to fast paced action. We can make sure to capture your most vital moments so you can preserve, 
            cherish and share them.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            For every event, there will be so many moments to capture. For every person, couple, group or team, there will be details you simply will not 
            have noticed with how things can fly by. 
            <br/><br/>
            But we’ll help to capture these moments for you so you can enjoy your day and concentrate on the important stuff.
             It’s never just another event for us. It’s our job to do the best we can for you.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            To sum up.. We’re two pretty cool dudes who are creative, organised (very much so.) and averagely handsome.
            If these things are important to you, then yes……. We ARE for you.
            Most importantly, we’d like to know more about you, so get in touch here.
